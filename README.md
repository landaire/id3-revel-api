id3-revel-api
=============

Models/controllers used for my ID3 API on lander.in, which runs off of the Revel framework. The API was developed for use in my [experimental branch of the HypeMachine Extension](https://github.com/landr0id/HypeMachine-Extension/tree/experimental), but it could be of some use to other people as well.

This README still needs documentation (obviously. Sorry).
